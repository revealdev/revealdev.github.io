# About

Hello my name is Reyza!
I am a Senior Software Engineer (Backend). Currently I work on Cermati.com
Yogyakarta branch, remotely from Surabaya. I have been professionally in IT
since 2018. Mostly using python, nodejs, and golang. But I am open to any
language / framework, it is just tools afterall

I love challenge, doing something
that I wasn't able to do is an exciting experience

**"Make your future self proud"**

is my favorite motto. I learnt programming since 2014, I taught myself in highschool
and very glad that I didn't falter. Looking back, it's a satisfaction to see how
much I have learned. And I strive to keep learning
